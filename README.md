# Heterogeneous Electric Vehicle Routing Problem (HEVRP)
The basic Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) involves identifying the optimal routes for vehicles to serve customers, aiming to minimize the total distance or other transportation costs. With the increase in air pollution caused by a substantial number of conventional motor vehicles, logistic companies are starting to use electric vehicles (EVs) into their distribution fleet. Therefore, the basic Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is extended to the Electric Vehicle Routing Problem (EVRP). Effective solutions to the EVRP can significantly reduce operational costs and improve the efficiency of EV fleets. Additionally, solving the EVRP involves complex decision-making related to routing, recharging, and managing heterogeneous vehicle characteristics, making it a key area of research in logistics optimization. Addressing these challenges can lead to more sustainable and economically viable transportation systems.

The EVRP can be represented using various modeling approaches, which may vary based on the specific variant of the problem. **Heterogeneous Electric Vehicle Routing Problem (HEVRP)** is one of the variants of EVRP which employs a fleet of vehicles with varying characteristics. A feasible solution to the **HEVRP** involves a set of routes that collectively achieve the minimum total travel distance, with each route performed by an electric vehicle that departs from the depot, visits customers, makes use of charging stations as needed, and returns to the depot. We further explores the impact of different fleet compositions and charging station locations on the overall efficiency of the routing solutions.

The complexity of EVRP often categorizes it as NP-hard, meaning that finding an exact solution within a reasonable time frame is computationally infeasible for large instances. This increased complexity highlights the need for effective metaheuristic approaches to solve the EVRP and its variants. Metaheuristic algorithms can be categorized into several types: nature-based, swarm-based, evolutionary-based, and physics-based. Examples of swarm-based metaheuristic algorithms include the Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA). We applied the **Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA)** to solve the **HEVRP**. The **Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA)** is particularly notable for its effectiveness in solving routing problems. Drawing inspiration from the bubble-net hunting strategy of humpback whales, WOA is known for its simplicity, fast convergence, and competitive performance compared to other optimization algorithms.
